 The August 2022 edition of the Tabular Playground Series is an opportunity to help the fictional company Keep It Dry improve its main product Super Soaker. The product is used in factories to absorb spills and leaks.


  * **Problem Statement**

  The company has just completed a large testing study for different product prototypes. Can you use this data to build a model that predicts product failures?
